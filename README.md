# sagemaker-forecast-flight-delays

Use Amazon SageMaker to forecast US flight delays using SageMaker's built-in linear learner algorithm to craete a regression model.

![Final Environment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3911650/56763994-ea7b9600-6760-11e9-9c8a-59fd2f90d2c9.png)

## Getting Started

Deploy the CloudFormation `infrastructure/cloudformation.json` template. The template creates a user with the following credentials and minimal required permisisons to complete the Lab:

- Username: _student_
- Password: _password_

## Instructions

1. Create a SageMaker training job using the linear learner algorithm. Set:
    - Role ARN to the ARN of the `sagemaker-role` created by the CloudFormation template
    - `model_type` to `regressor` and `feature_dim` to 716
    - Configure the `train` data channel to point to the `Flight_training.csv` file in S3
    - Configure a second `test` data channel to point to the `Flight_test.csv` file in S3
1. Create a model using the model output artifacts created in S3 by the training job
1. Create an endpoint to serve the model
1. In Cloud9, issue the following command to retrieve an inference from the endpoint and save it in a file named `prediction.json`:

    ```sh
    # test flight between San Francisco and Indianapolis
    flight_vector=1550,1609,19.0,19.0,1,1,2307,257.0,1943.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
    aws sagemaker-runtime invoke-endpoint --endpoint-name flight-delays --content-type 'text/csv' --body $flight_vector prediction.json
    ```

## Cleaning Up

Delete Endpoint, endpoint configuration, model, and S3 bucket data. Then delete the CloudFormation stack to remove all the remaining resources used in the Lab.
